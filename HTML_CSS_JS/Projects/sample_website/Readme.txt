How to Run the Website
Create the Project Folder:

Create a folder named sample_website on your local machine.
Create Files:

Inside the sample_website folder, create the files mentioned above (index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html, login.html, style.css, script.js).
Run the Website:

Open index.html in your web browser. You can navigate between the pages using the menu and test the login functionality.
Explanation:
HTML Files: Each page (index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html, login.html) has its own content and is linked through the navigation menu.
CSS: The style.css file defines the styles for all pages, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
JavaScript: The script.js file contains a simple login validation script that checks for a hard-coded username and password (admin / password123).
