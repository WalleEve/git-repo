This Tkinter tutorial introduces you to the exciting world of GUI programming in Python.
tkinter tutorial

Tkinter is pronounced as tea-kay-inter. Tkinter is the Python interface to Tk, which is the GUI toolkit for Tcl/Tk.

Tcl (pronounced as tickle) is a scripting language often used in testing, prototyping, and GUI development. Tk is an open-source, cross-platform widget toolkit used by many different programming languages to build GUI programs.

Python implements the Tkinter as a module. Tkinter is a wrapper of C extensions that use Tcl/Tk libraries.

Tkinter allows you to develop desktop applications. It’s a very good tool for GUI programming in Python.

Tkinter is a good choice because of the following reasons:

    Easy to learn.
    Use very little code to make a functional desktop application.
    Layered design.
    Portable across all operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    Pre-installed with the standard Python library.

This tutorial assumes that you already have Python 3.x installed on your computer. If it’s not the case, you need to install Python first.
