# TKINTER:
"""
Python provides the standard library Tkinter for creating the graphical user interface for desktop based applications.

An empty Tkinter top-level window can be created by using the following steps.
1. import the tkinter module.
2. Create the main application window.
3. Add the weight like labes, buttons, frames etc to the window.
4. Call the main event loop so that the sections can take place on the user's computer screen.


"""
# Example:

from tkinter import *

# creating the application main window
top = Tk()

# Entering the event main loop
top.mainloop()
