--# Oracle Triggers:
A Triggers is like a store proedure that Oracle Database invokes automatically whenever a specific event occurs.
Note: The Database can detect only system-defined events.
	  We cannot define our own events.
	  
9.1 Overview of Triggers:
	Like a stored procedure a trigger is a named PL/SQL unit that is stored in the databse abd can be invoked repeatedly.
	Unlike a store procedure, we can enable and disbale a trigger, but we can not explicitly invoke it.
	
	While a trigger is enabled, the databse automatically invokes it-that is, the trigger fires--whenever its triggering event occers. While a trigger is disable it does not fire.
	
	The trigger is said to be created on or defined on the item, which is either a table , a view, a schema, or the database.
	
	By default, a trigger is created in the enabled state.
	
	If the trigger is created on a table or view, then the triggering event is composed of DML statements, and the trigger is called a DML trigger.
	
	A crossedition trigger is a DML trigger for use only in edition-based redefinition.
	
	If the trigger is created on a schema or the database, then the triggering event is composed of wither DDL or Database operation statements, and the trigger is called a system trigger.
		Queries in the trigger see the current read-consistent materiazed view of referenced tables and any data changed in the same transaction.
		Updates in the trigger wait for existing data lock to be released before processing.
	
	An INSTEAD IF TRIGGER is either:
	. A DML trigger created on either a noneditioning view or a nedted table column of a noneditioning view.
	. A system trigger defined on a CREATE statement.
	
9.3 DML Triggers:
	A DML trigger is created on either a table or view, and its triggering event is composed of the DML statements DELETE, INSERT and UPDATE.
	
	To create a trigger that fires in response to a MERGE statmeent, create trigger on the INSERT and UPDATE statement to which the MERGE operation decomposes.
	
	A DML trigger either a simple or compound.
	
	A Simple DML trigger fires at exactly one of these timing points:
	. Before the triggering statement runs
	. After the triggering statement runs 
	. Before each row that the triggering statement affects 
	. After each row that the triggering statement affects. 
	
	A compound DML trigger created on a table or editioning view can fire at one, some, or all of the precedsing timing points. 
	
	
9.3.1 Conditional Predicts for Detecting Triggering DML Statements 

	INSERTING An INSERT statement fired the trigger.
	UPDATING An UPDATE statement fired the trigger.
	UPDATING ('column') An UPDATE statement that affected the specified column fired the trigger.
	DELETING A DELETE statement fired the trigger.
	
	Example 9-1 Trigger uses Conditional Predictions to Detect Triggering Statement
	
	CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER t 
		BEFORE 
			INSERT OR 
			UPDATE OF slary, department_id OR 
			DELETE 
		ON employees 
	BEGIN 
		CASE 
			WHEN INSERTING THEN 
				DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Inserting');
			WHEN UPDATING('salary') THEN 
				DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Updating Salary');
			WHEN UPDATING('department_id') THEN 
				DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Updating department ID');
			WHEN DELETING  THEN 
				DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleting');
		END CASE;
	END;
