# NUMPY 
# ADDING, REMOVING, and SORTING ELEMENTS IN AN ARRAY
# This dection covers np.sort(), np.concatenate()

# Sorting an element is simple with np.sort()
# we can specify the axis, kind, and order 
# when we call the function.

arr = np.array([2, 1, 5, 3, 7, 4, 6, 8])


# we can quickly sort the numbers in ascending order with:

print(np.sort(arr))

# in addition to sort,
# which returns a sorted copy of an array,
# We can use:

"""
. argsort, which is an indirect sort along a specified axis
. lexsort, which is an indirect stable sort on multiple keys
. searchsorted, which will find elements in a sorted array, 
. partition, which is a partial sort.

# We can concatenate them with np.concatenate()

c = np.concatenate((a, b))
print(c)

x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
y = np.array([[5, 6]])

# We can concatenate with 

z = np.concatenate((x, y), axis=0)
