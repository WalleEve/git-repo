# Python assertions 
"""
Assertions are a convenient tool for documenting, degugging and testing.
code during development.

In Python, assertions are statments that we can use to set sanity checks during the Development process.
Assertions allow us to test the correctness of our code by checking if some specific condition remain true,
which can come in handy while we're debugging code.

The assertion condition should always be True unless we have a bug in our program.
If the condition turns out to be False, then the assertion raise an exception and 
terminates the execution of our program.
